My study of programming began with mastering HTML and CSS. After completing an online course on
YouTube, I decided to quickly move on to practical experience. I was advised to try a challenge,
specifically to develop a few small pages and practice the basic sections of HTML and CSS.

I used tasks from
the challenge
of [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/html-and-css-code-challenges-for-beginners/).

### The first task within the challenge:

**Create a tribute page.** Choose a historical figure who’s meaningful to you and create a webpage dedicated to them. The
   webpage should include:

- A title or heading with the person’s name
- An image of the person
- A caption for the image
- A timeline of the person’s life in the form of a list
- This can be completed with only HTML, but use CSS to give it some style.

### My personal tasks:

1. Create a navigation bar using `ul` or `ol` lists.
2. Arrange site blocks using `flex`.
3. Learn to use pseudo-elements `::after` and `::before`.
4. Use a `hover` effect with images and add `transition`.
5. Create a simple animation with text in the navigation bar.
6. Learn to style quotes.
7. Create a small form, use: `email input`, `textarea`, `button`, `select`.
8. Create a duplicate of the site in Ukrainian and link the resulting HTML file to a language toggle
   button.
